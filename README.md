# GPS-Overlay
This is a basic python project that takes a GPX file (GPS data) and a video and
overlays the GPS data onto individual frames of the video. While there are already
existing software to overlay GPS data on a video, this project is unique as it
allows users to create their own custom overlay widgets using HTML. As far as I
am aware, no other software provides this customizability.

The project is still in the early stages and features will be continue to be added.
